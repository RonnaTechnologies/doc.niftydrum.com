The screenshot below illustrates the process for configuring the snare drum.</p> <p> </p> <p>On the left side, you can assign the MIDI note for the pad\u2014such as note 38 for the snare. Below the note input, you\u2019ll find the velocity curve editor, which uses B\u00e9zier controls for precise adjustments. You can drag and drop the endpoints and the two middle control points to shape the curve according to your needs. The horizontal axis reflects the raw MIDI velocity detected by the sensor, while the vertical axis shows the velocity value transmitted over USB. This setup lets you fine-tune the responsiveness and dynamics of your triggers.</p> <p>Moving from left to right, you can adjust the trigger gain within a range of 0.1 to 5. This allows you to boost the input sensitivity of the trigger, enhancing the volume of ghost notes when the velocity curve alone isn\u2019t sufficient. It\u2019s important to note that the gain is applied after a strike has been detected, so it doesn\u2019t impact the threshold setting.</p> <p>Next is the threshold setting, which sets the minimum signal level the piezo must exceed for a hit to register. This ensures only intentional strikes are detected, effectively filtering out unwanted noise and preventing false triggers.</p>"},{"location":"2.app/#hi-hat-pedal-configuration","title":"Hi-hat pedal configuration","text":"<p>The last item of the dropdown menu is the hi-hat pedal configuration.
