# The App

## Configure NiftyDrum

!!! warning "App Usage: Configuration Only"
    This app is designed **only for configuration purposes**.
    While running, it continuously transfers data between your PC and the board.
    For optimal performance, **close the app before playing**.

NiftyDrum is fully configurable, allowing you to adjust parameters like scan time, mask time, decay, threshold, etc.
To simplify customization, a dedicated desktop application is available, compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS.

Below are all the different commands the app can send to the board.

### General Board Commands

| Command                  | Description                                      |

### How the app works

The app simplifies customization by organizing everything logically: instruments are selected via a drop-down, while MIDI notes and velocity curves are managed separately from trigger settings for a cleaner, more efficient setup.

## How to install the app

he app is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux and can be downloaded directly from the official [NiftyDrum.com](https://niftydrum.com/#software){:target="_blank"} website. Follow the OS-specific instructions provided on the site.

### Windows

On Windows, the app is distributed as a `.zip` file, so no installation is required, simply extract and run it.
Note that, if that's not already done, you will have to install the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable package](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe){:target="_blank"}.

### Linux

For Linux, the app is packaged as a `.deb` file. You can install it using your preferred package manager or by running the following command in a terminal:

=== "Ubuntu 22.04"

    ```bash
    sudo apt install --reinstall ./NiftyDrum-1.0.0-Ubuntu-22.04.deb
    ```

=== "Ubuntu 24.04"

    ```bash
    sudo apt install --reinstall ./NiftyDrum-1.0.0-Ubuntu-24.04.deb
    ```

=== "debian"

    ```bash
    sudo apt install --reinstall ./NiftyDrum-1.0.0-Linux.deb
    ```

### MacOS

The MacOS version of the app is provided as a `.zip` file. Just extract it and run the application.
If you're using an Apple Silicon Mac, you may be prompted to install Rosetta the first time you launch the app.

## Piezo trigger configuration

Customize each piezo trigger by selecting your desired instrument from the dropdown menu.
The screenshot below illustrates the process for configuring the snare drum.

![Snare drum trigger configuration](assets/app-trigger-light.png){ .light-mode-only .img-shadow-lg  }
![Snare drum trigger configuration](assets/app-trigger.png){ .dark-mode-only .img-shadow-lg  }

On the left side, you can assign the MIDI note for the pad—such as note 38 for the snare. Below the note input, you’ll find the velocity curve editor, which uses Bézier controls for precise adjustments. You can drag and drop the endpoints and the two middle control points to shape the curve according to your needs.
The horizontal axis reflects the raw MIDI velocity detected by the sensor, while the vertical axis shows the velocity value transmitted over USB. This setup lets you fine-tune the responsiveness and dynamics of your triggers.

Moving from left to right, you can adjust the trigger gain within a range of 0.1 to 5. This allows you to boost the input sensitivity of the trigger, enhancing the volume of ghost notes when the velocity curve alone isn’t sufficient. It’s important to note that the gain is applied after a strike has been detected, so it doesn’t impact the threshold setting.

Next is the threshold setting, which sets the minimum signal level the piezo must exceed for a hit to register. This ensures only intentional strikes are detected, effectively filtering out unwanted noise and preventing false triggers.

## Hi-Hat Pedal Configuration

The last item in the dropdown menu is the **hi-hat pedal configuration**. Unlike other inputs, it does not include standard parameters like scan time or mask time.

!!! note "Hi-Hat Implementation Status"
    The hi-hat implementation is currently **experimental**. The app settings may evolve in future updates.

### Parameters

The hi-hat pedal configuration includes four key parameters:

| Parameter            | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Update interval**  | Sets the frequency at which the hi-hat pedal updates.                      |
| **Noise threshold**  | Ignores pedal changes below this value to filter out noise.                |
| **Pedal offset**     | Determines whether the hi-hat is fully closed.                            |
| **Velocity threshold (Trig)** | Sets the sensitivity threshold for triggering a foot chick note.   |

![Hi-hat pedal configuration (Light Mode)](assets/app-hihat-light.png){ .light-mode-only .img-shadow-lg }
![Hi-hat pedal configuration (Dark Mode)](assets/app-hihat.png){ .dark-mode-only .img-shadow-lg }

### CC Message Behavior

- The **Update interval** defines the minimum delay (in microseconds) between two CC messages, typically set to **10ms**.
- The **Noise threshold** sets the minimum change in value required to send a CC message.

### Foot Chick Note Trigger

The **Pedal offset** and **Velocity threshold (Trig)** determine whether a foot chick note is sent, with the latter acting as a sensitivity threshold.

## Firmware upgrade

The app also supports **firmware upgrades** for your board.

### Steps to Upgrade Firmware

1. From the app's main screen, click the **"gear" icon** to access the **Advanced Settings** screen.
2. Select a firmware file (if downloaded as a `.zip`, **unzip it first**).
3. Ensure the file has a `.bin` extension and is an **officially supported firmware**.
4. Click the **`Upload`** button and wait for the process to complete.

![Firmware Update (Light Mode)](assets/app-fw-light.png){ .light-mode-only .img-shadow-lg }
![Firmware Update (Dark Mode)](assets/app-fw.png){ .dark-mode-only .img-shadow-lg }

!!! warning
    **Do not unplug the board** during the firmware upload.

!!! tip "Troubleshooting"
    If the firmware upload fails or the board is accidentally unplugged. Download [`tkg-flash`](https://github.com/TheKikGen/stm32-tkg-hid-bootloader/tree/master/cli/binaries_dist){:target="_blank"}. **Double-press the reset button** on the board. Upload the firmware via terminal:
       ```bash
       ./tkg-flash NiftyDrum.bin
       ```

Once the upload is complete, the board will **restart automatically**, and the app will **reconnect** to it.
