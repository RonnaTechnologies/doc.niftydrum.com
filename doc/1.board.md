This board features the following interfaces:

- Terminal blocks for sensor connections
- USB Type-C port for laptop or PC connectivity
- 9 potentiometers for sensitivity adjustment
- 2 status LEDs
- Reset button
- Raspberry Pi-compatible GPIO header
- 4 mounting holes for secure installation

## Connecting Sensors

The board provides 9 piezo inputs, supporting up to 9 single-zone pads.

### Hi-Hat Sensors

On the left side of the board, two dedicated terminal blocks are reserved for hi-hat sensors:

- **Top terminal block**: Connects to an FSR (Force Sensing Resistor) sensor for hi-hat controller input
- **Bottom terminal block**: Connects to a piezo sensor for hi-hat cymbal trigger

### Standard Pads and Cymbals

The remaining eight terminal blocks, located at the bottom of the board, accommodate regular pads and cymbals.

### Important Notes

- For all terminal blocks, the ground pin is positioned on the **left-hand side**
- Nine onboard potentiometers enable hardware-level sensitivity adjustments for maximum flexibility
- If unsure about sensitivity settings, leave potentiometers at their midpoint for balanced performance

## MIDI Outputs

The board offers two methods for transmitting MIDI notes and Control Changes:

- **USB-C port**: Outputs USB MIDI messages
- **GPIO UART pins**: Raspberry Pi GPIO-compatible interface

## USB-C Port

Using NiftyDrum as a USB device is the recommended method for receiving MIDI messages. This configuration enables:

- Integration with DAW software for high-quality sound output from your laptop
- Control and configuration via the [official app](2.app.md)

### App Features

The official app provides comprehensive control over your NiftyDrum board:

- Customize MIDI note assignments for each trigger
- Design custom velocity curves per trigger
- Adjust advanced parameters including gain, threshold, scan time, mask time, and decay
- Update board firmware to the latest version
## Raspberry-Pi hat form factor

The board is designed with a Raspberry Pi 4 HAT form factor, ensuring seamless integration.
