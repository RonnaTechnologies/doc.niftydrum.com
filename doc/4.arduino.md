## That's a Blue Pill

NiftyDrum is powered by the STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller—the same chip found in the iconic "Blue Pill" development board.

If you're unfamiliar with the Blue Pill, it’s a widely recognized and versatile board based on the STM32F103C microcontroller family. With 72MHz clock speed, 64KB of flash memory, and 20KB of RAM, it offers plenty of flexibility for customization and experimentation.

For an accessible way to program NiftyDrum, I recommend using [STM32duino](https://github.com/stm32duino/Arduino_Core_STM32){:target=_blank}, which allows you to program the board directly from the Arduino IDE.
